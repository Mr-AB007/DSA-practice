# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Java. It is intended for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving skills by working on common DSA problems.

## Contents

### Searching Algorithms
1. **Linear Search**
   - Searches for an element by iterating through the entire array.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
2. **Binary Search**
   - Searches an element in a sorted array using divide and conquer.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

### Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
2. **Selection Sort**
   - Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
3. **Insertion Sort**
   - Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
4. **Merge Sort**
   - Merge Sort is a **divide-and-conquer** sorting algorithm that recursively splits an array into two halves, sorts them, and 
     merges the sorted halves.
   - It **stable** and **efficient for large datasets**
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(N) , due to temporary arrays.

### Data Structures
1. **Arrays**
2. **Linked Lists**
3. **Stacks**
4. **Queues**
5. **Trees**
6. **Graphs**

### Common Problems
- Two Sum
- Reverse a Linked List
- Detect Cycle in a Linked List
- Implement Stack using Arrays
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
